This repository contains my Artificial Neural Network (ANN) implementation report, detailing the development and evaluation of various ANN models.

This project involves:

Data preprocessing
Model implementation
Training and evaluation

Data Preprocessing:

Splitting data into training, validation, and test sets.
Removing anomalies and outliers.
Standardizing data.
Model Implementation:

Implemented in Java using core libraries.
Utilized OOP principles.
Developed Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models with enhancements like momentum, annealing, bold driver, and weight decay.
Training and Evaluation:

Compared multiple models.
Selected the best-performing model based on mean squared error (MSE).
Achieved high accuracy with an R-squared value of 0.9829 on test data.
